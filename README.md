# elementary_signal_scripts
Python scripts for processing and generating elementary signals.
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts developed for the processing of elementary signals. The scripts are organized into three modules:

1) generate.py: Contains functions for generating discrete-time signals such as unit impulse, unit step, rectangular pulse, triangular pulse, exponential signal, and random signal.

2) modify.py: Contains functions for transforming discrete-time signals such as temporal and amplitude shifts, temporal and amplitude inversions, signal addition, signal multiplication, and signal convolution.

3) plot.py: Contains functions for signal visualization, as well as saving and loading existing signals. The module includes functions for plotting signals (with the option to save the plot in PNG format), saving signals in .npy format, and loading signals from .npy files.

These scripts are useful for anyone working with elementary signals in the field of signal processing, and can be easily integrated into existing Python projects. Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to this repository.
